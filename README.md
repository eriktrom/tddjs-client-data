tddjs-client-data
=================

Learn JavaScript/CoffeeScript by following along with Christian Johansen's book 'Test-Driven JavaScript Development'


This repo includes the code form chapter's 3, 4, 11, 12, & 13.

Other code from the book is located in tddjs-client-dom and tddjs-server (which you can find within my account, although honestly, I'm not sure why you'd want to. Which I suppose begs the question of why I would post it? Dunno, feeling frisky today)
