tddjs-client-data
=================

Learn JavaScript/CoffeeScript by following along with Christian Johansen's book 'Test-Driven JavaScript Development'


This repo includes the code form chapter's 3, 4, 11, 12, & 13. (although chpts 3 and 4 have almost no code -- the book get good around chpt 11)

Other code from the book is located in tddjs-client-dom and tddjs-server (which you can find within my account, although honestly, I'm not sure why you'd want to. Which I suppose begs the question of why I would post it? Dunno, feeling frisky today)

And since we're on the topic of writing things no one will read, the code for each chapter is located on it's own branch
